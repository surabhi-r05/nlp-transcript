Riya: Hey everyone, thanks for joining.
Tanisha: Let’s quickly go over the client demo feedback from yesterday.
Tanisha: Overall, the client felt the navigation was confusing.
Surya: Yes, especially the reports page.
Tanisha: Just an FYI for everyone — they liked the overall idea, but clarity is an issue.
Tanisha: Now coming to next steps.
Surya: I will prepare two redesign options for the dashboard by Friday.
Surabhi: Once Surya finalizes the redesign, I will update the frontend components.
Surabhi: After the frontend changes, I will also fix responsiveness issues.
Tanisha: After both the redesign and frontend updates are ready, I will review everything.
Tanisha: I’ll update the client after the internal review.
Tanisha: Let’s schedule a follow-up meeting next Monday at 10 AM to discuss the final version.
Riya: Sounds good.
Tanisha: Thanks everyone, let’s sync again once this is done.
