Riya: Hey everyone, let’s get started.
Tanisha: Based on today’s discussion, we need to address the dashboard issues.
Surya: I will redesign the dashboard layout and share options by Thursday.
Surabhi: Once Surya shares the redesign, I will update the frontend components.
Surabhi: After that, I will fix the responsiveness issues across devices.
Tanisha: After the frontend updates are complete, I will review everything.
Tanisha: I’ll inform the client once the review is done.
Riya: That sounds like a good plan.
Tanisha: Thanks everyone.
